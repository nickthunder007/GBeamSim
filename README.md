# FSOBeamSim

**FSOBeamSim** is an interactive MATLAB App Designer project for visualizing how a Gaussian laser beam propagates through free space. It serves as an intuitive and educational platform that gradually guides users from fundamental optical beam physics to the basics of free-space optical (FSO) communication.
